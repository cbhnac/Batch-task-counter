# **Batch task counter**
This repository contains a variety of Azure functions.

It currently has a function with the purpose of counting the number of tasks left in an Azure batch job and a function which locally outputs task failures.

Replace the setting values in `local.settings.json` with your own for it to work locally.

After publishing the function to Azure make sure to edit the application settings.
